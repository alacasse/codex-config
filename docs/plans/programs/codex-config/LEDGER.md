# Codex Config Program Ledger

## Purpose

Track active and candidate codex-config workflow work in one canonical program
ledger. This ledger is the only active executable backlog source under
`docs/plans/` for `add-to-ledger`, `plan-batch`, and `work-batch`.

## Current Direction

- Keep repo-owned workflow skills project-neutral.
- Keep Planning Artifact Layout v1 pickup rooted at `docs/plans/CURRENT.md`.
- Keep Markdown and JSON readable, diffable, and repairable.
- Keep SQLite optional and rebuildable as a reporting projection.
- Keep all codex-config workflow and skill-cleanup work in this ledger.
- Do not create a dispatch or runway until one row is explicitly selected by
  `plan-batch`.

CCFG-19 remains unselected. |

## Recommended Work Order

1. Start pickup from root and program `CURRENT.md`.
2. CCFG-18 is closed; no selected dispatch, queued batch, or active runway
   remains.
3. Stop without selecting, refreshing, dispatching, or preparing successor
   work. A future explicit `plan-batch` request owns the next selection.
4. CCFG-19 remains open and unselected.
5. Do not revive archived APR/PST ledgers as pickup sources.
6. Keep CCFG-11 open but do not execute its displaced runway.

## Closeout Rules

- Close CCFG-18 through CCFG-29 only from the acceptance evidence and stop
  boundaries in the local intake file and immutable accepted design snapshot.
- A redesign closeout must record controlling generation, planning root,
  implementation root, relevant revisions, temporary bridges, and legacy
  ownership removed.
- CCFG-18 closed through
  `batches/ccfg-18-candidate-generation/closeout.md` without selecting CCFG-19.
- The `ccfg-18-stable-control-bootstrap` closeout marks CCFG-18 `Prepared`, not
  `Closed`, records the changed stable commit and fresh-session handoff, and
  preserves all candidate-generation remainder under the same finding identity.
- The stable pre-creation gate, candidate lineage, strict transition,
  generation identity, fixture isolation, quiescence, and rollback are proven;
  `ccfg-18-candidate-generation` is completed.
- CCFG-27 does not switch the default generation.
- CCFG-28 switches only after physical deletion and clean-install proof, then
  closes under the pinned stable controller and stops.
- CCFG-29 removes the cross-checkout bridge and restores `master` as integrated
  toolchain source.
