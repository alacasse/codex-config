## Open Ledger

- Ledger: `docs/plans/programs/codex-config/LEDGER.md`
- Open ledger rows: CCFG-2 through CCFG-6, CCFG-9 through CCFG-11, and
  CCFG-26 through CCFG-29.
- Pending ledger row: CCFG-25.
- Closed ledger rows: CCFG-18 through CCFG-24 and CCFG-30 through CCFG-33.
  CCFG-21 closes all six COR-004 planning-contract acceptance keys without live
  planning migration or command integration.
  CCFG-22 closes all nine COR-005 authoring acceptance keys with candidate-only
  installation and no command-owner runtime dependency.
  CCFG-23 closes all six COR-006 behavioral-harness acceptance keys and six
  aliases across all 31 immutable contracts without production ownership
  transfer or real cutover.

## Next Safe Action

Stop at the completed Slice 2 receipt. Candidate commit
`12f70727f7496e2aa2d5fff9b748ee97e19e63a2` contains the exact independently
reviewed diff; Slice 3 remains pending in the same active CCFG-25 runway. Do not
execute Slice 3, create closeout, or select a successor in this flight.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop if work treats closed CCFG-18 or its completed runway as active work.
- Stop if planning weakens strict `cross-checkout-context/v1` or treats the
  planning snapshot as a live execution lease.
- Stop if any default stable-home installed link resolves to the redesign branch
  or candidate clone.
- Stop if work treats the completed CCFG-24B dispatch or runway as active state.
- Stop if planning would write outside the canonical stable planning repository.
- Stop if candidate code or helpers would control canonical state before final
  integration.
- Stop if work would repeat command-owner redesign intake or create new
  identities instead of amending CCFG-18 through CCFG-29.
- Stop if work treats CCFG-19 or CCFG-20 as active after completed closeout.
- Stop if work would select from archived APR/PST ledgers instead of the canonical
  codex-config ledger.
- Stop if work would execute the displaced CCFG-11 runway without replanning.
- Stop if work would copy archived history into the active ledger row-by-row.
- Stop if a generic reusable skill receives project-specific paths, commands,
  caches, or planning layouts.
- Stop if work treats closed CCFG-21, CCFG-22, CCFG-23, CCFG-30, CCFG-31,
  CCFG-32, or CCFG-33 as active work.
- Stop if CCFG-32 execution semantics, Git-derived queue currentness, or broad
  live-lease protocol topology are restored.
- Stop if CCFG-22 or CCFG-23 behavior is widened into production ownership beyond
  their accepted closeouts.
- Stop if CCFG-33 exact-commit acceptance restores source-hash authority, nested
  reporter pytest, a permanent cache, committed generated receipt, or CI workflow.
- Stop if work executes, resumes, or closes the superseded
  `ccfg-24-intake-ownership-transfer` dispatch or runway.
- Stop if work executes or reopens CCFG-24A rather than consuming its closeout.
- Stop if work reopens CCFG-24 or treats its closeout as authority to select or
  prepare CCFG-25 without the explicit request already recorded in this dispatch.
- Stop if future work restores an APR intake route, a `legacy-removal` state-owner
  escape hatch, or stable-home ownership from the candidate generation.
- Stop if CCFG-24 through CCFG-29 retain replaced CCFG-23 fixtures or tests
  without a named caller, reason, owner, and removal condition.
- Stop if another dispatch or runway is selected, queued, activated, or created
  while CCFG-25 is queued or active.
- Stop if CCFG-25 introduces a new planning schema, store, queue transaction,
  lifecycle state, public command, persistent draft store, helper behavior,
  runner protocol, or compatibility layer.
- Stop if planner/reviewer independence is not direct and mechanically evidenced.
- Stop if CCFG-25 removes or narrows any proceed/stop, delegation, recovery,
  validation, review, commit, receipt, finalization, closeout, reconciliation, or
  strict execution-safety responsibility reserved for CCFG-26.
- Stop if another live planning caller or runner semantic owner requiring an edit
  is discovered outside the exact amended Slice 2 ceiling.
- Preserve `select-dispatch`, `create-spec`, `execute`, and `closeout` as serialized
  compatibility identities through CCFG-25. CCFG-27 owns their migration/removal
  decision; final physical cleanup is due no later than CCFG-29.
- Stop if CCFG-25 closeout selects, dispatches, queues, or prepares CCFG-26.
